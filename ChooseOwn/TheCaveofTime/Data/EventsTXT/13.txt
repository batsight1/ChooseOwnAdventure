You decide to wait, but soon regret it. A guard
visits you twice a day and brings you only black
bread and water. In a few days you feel almost too
weak to escape even if you have the chance.
But just as you are beginning to despair of ever
regaining your freedom, the guard walks in, smiling.
"The King has ordered you out of here," he
says. "We have a much more important
prisoner-a man who insulted the King's horse."
He laughs in your face. You don't know whether
he is telling the truth or not, but he holds the door
and waves you out. You walk down the long flight
of stone steps to the main courtyard, free againat least for the moment. The drawbridge is down
and there seems to be nothing in the way of your
leaving the castle.
There is a splendid black horse tied up near you,
probably owned by one of the knights. It occurs to
you that you could cover a lot of ground on that
horse before anyone realizes what happened.
