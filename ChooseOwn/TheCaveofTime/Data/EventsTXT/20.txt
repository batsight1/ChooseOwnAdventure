The tunnelto the left winds around like a spiral,
passing several more funnels. You tum down one
of them, then climb steeply. In a few moments you
climb through a hole and emerge in a desert. The
weather is extremely hot----certainly over 100 de-
grees, but the sun is just about to set, so it should
be getting cooler. In the distance is a range of
mountains. which look extremely high, yet are
bare of snow. You have no idea whether you are in
the past, the future, or the present. Then you see
something that fascinates and disturbs you. The
sand seems to be fused into yellowish glass as if
heated in a furnace. As you examine the sand
more closely, you feelthe air getiing even hotter.
Suddenly you realize the sun is not setting, but
risingl The noontime temperafure must be more
than life can stand. As the sun rises higher, you feel
a blistering wave of heat. The light is almost blind-
ing. Could it be that you are witnessing the end of
the world?
You turn and walk back out of the cave. It
should be dawn by now, but, as you grope your
way toward the entrance, you can't see any light
coming into the cave. You press against the walls,
feeling for an opening. Your hands pass across
something cold, wet, and hard. Ice! The entance
is sealed by it. Blocks of ice protrude into the cave.
You step back, feeling confused and helpless.
You wish ilwerejust a dream. You retrace your
steps a way, trying to think clearly. You know that
your only chance to get out of the cave is to follow
one of the two branches before you.
