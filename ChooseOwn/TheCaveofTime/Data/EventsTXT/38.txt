Y_ou fegl you must be far in the future. Are you
really.looking at an alien spaceship? If so, you
would rather watch from a safe distance. you
climb rapidly up the hill-wondering how you got
to this shange time.
el,"q4 of you is a niche in the rocks. you step
inside. You realize you are in the bottom of the
crevasse you fell into from the Ice Age. Even if you
wanted to get back to that time, there is no way
you could do so. You keep walking. Eventually
your approach open ground on the opposite side
of the hill.
Now you can see a vast stretch of open
country-hilly, rocky, and mostly barren. Yet
thousands of people are constructing a huge wall!
All over the landscape you see oxen pulling carts
filled with rocks. The wall is at least twenty feet high
and extends as far as the eye can see.
Ladders are strung up agaisnt the wall, and on
every rung a man or woman is stationed. They
hand rocks up one to another to the top of the wall.
You find this sight hardly less amazing than the
sight of the alien spaceship, for it appears that you
are witnessing the building of the Great Wall of
China.
