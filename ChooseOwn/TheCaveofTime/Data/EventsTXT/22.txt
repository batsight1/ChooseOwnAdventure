The laughing knight helps you up on his horse
and you sit uncomfortably as it canters over the
countryside. After traveling a mile or so, you come
to a great, stone castle. The horse trots across the
drawbridge and into the stable.
"Jump," the knight calls to you, and you slide
off the rear of the horse. The knight escorts you
into the grand chamber of the castle. All about you
are stewards, attendants, and knights. A few min-
utes later you find yourself bowing before the King
himself.
After hearing your story, the King looks gravely
at his advisors and knights and stewards. "Does
anyone believe this tale?" he asks.
Everyone cries back, "No, Your Majesty," or
"Certainly not, Your Majesty."
"Then tell us the truth!" the King roars at you.
