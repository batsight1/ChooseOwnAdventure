If you take the train, it may ruin your chance to
retuin to the Cave of Time. It seems best to stay
close to the tunnel. At any rate, you decide you will
be able to think better after getting something to
eat, so you walk over to the farmhouse.
The farmer's wife gives you a bowl of soup, but
she won't b elievethe story you make up to explain
your presence there. You soon get the idea you
are not welcome, so you tudge on into town,
where the innkeeper lets you have a room for the
night.
The next moming you get a ride on a coach to
Philadelphia. A Quaker family takes you in and
helps you get work as a carpenter's apprentice'
You don't like the job, and soon you leave
Philadelphia to go to New York, where you are
able to find a job working for a newspaper. Even-
tually you travel all over the world. You live a long
and wonderful life, dying just a few years before
you are born.
