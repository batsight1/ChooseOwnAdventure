There is a certian tone in the knight's laughter
that does not inspire your trust, so you thank him
graviously and tell him you have other business to
attend to.
"Then go to it," the knight replies. "Take care to
keep your business drier than yourself!"
He gallops off in a rush. You are glad to be rid of him.
Eager to find the entrance to the Cave of Time,
you climb up behind the rock wall that slopes into
the pond. After searching for an hour, you find a
tunnel leading underground.
