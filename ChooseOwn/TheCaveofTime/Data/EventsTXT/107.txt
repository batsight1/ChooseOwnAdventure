Although you feel you would probably enjoy
the printing business more than a career as a soap
maker, you wish to remain free to take advantage
of some other oppurtunity.
The work with Uncle Ted is tedious. You feel
you could not bear life devoted to making candles
and soap. You spend most of your spare time
reading what books you can lay hold of, but you
are anxious to travel and see the world.
Not long afterwards, you sign up on the brigan-
tine, ina, as a deck hand. The ship is owned by a
rich merchant, and it is bound for Barbados in the
West Indies with a load of lumber and then on to
England.
You find life at sea much harder than you ex-
pected, especially when you are required to climb
the riggin in a howling gale, but eventually you
become captain of your own ship. In every place
you visit you ask the people you meet wheter
they have ever heard of the Cave of Time.
