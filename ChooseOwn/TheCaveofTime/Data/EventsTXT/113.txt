When you tell the guard you are innocent, he
scowls and slams shut the door fo the cell." You'll
not take me to the devil with you!" he calls back
as he walks away.
The next day you are brought into a courtroom
before a sten looking judge. After hearing the
charges agaisnt you and listening to what you have
to say, he shakes his head and scowls angrily.
Then he looks at the prosecutor and pounds his fist
on the bench.
"Your charge against this person is for disor-
derly conduct, but the specifications you give are
'strange clothes and telling stories invented by the
devil.' What you really are charging is witchcraft!
There will be no such madness in my court and let
me have none of it again from you! Case dis-
missed."
The judge not only sets you free, but afterwards
gives you a home to live in and helps you on your
way to a good and happy life in the Eighteenth
Century.
