After hearing of the forbidding world you've
witnessed atyour end of the Cave of Time, Louisa
is agreeable to your helping her ty to find the way
back to her entance.
"Tell me about the world outside your entrance
to the Cave of Time. Is it in America? What year is it
there?" you ask, as the two of you walk along.
"The year 2022, of course," she replies.
"You mean people are still wearing blue jeans
then?" you ask.
"They've come back into style lately," she
laughs.
"You must have some new inventions that we
did not have in my time. Tell me aboutyour most
modern things."
"l think the best things are the bicycle trails.
Since 1997 they've allowed no new roads to be
built--<nly bike trials---and now there are as many
miles of bike trails as there are of roads for cars.
"So you can really bike all over the countr5r?"
you ask.
"Sure-and not alongside buses and trucks and
crazrT drivers, but through forests and across plains
and deserts and along rivers and steams. I some-
times feel like biking lorcver that way, and there
are hostels for bikers where you can sleep in com-
fort for almost nothing. Most of the cost is paid for
by taxes on gasoline."
Suddenly you feel the ground gving way be-
neath your feet. You and Louisa are falling. The
two of you land at the base of a steep bluff, shaken
but unharmed, alongside a road. You wonder
what year you have anived in. Then, nearby, you
see a billboard thatsays, "CADILLAC-the Carof
the Year, every Yearl"
"What's a Cadillac?" Louisa asks.
