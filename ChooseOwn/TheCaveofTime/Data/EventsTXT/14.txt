In a moment you are across the bridge and
galloping over the countryside, feeling a good deal
smarter than the King and his knights. When you
pass some shepherds and wave, they wave back.
You stop to rest at the cottage of a friendly
goatherd, who feeds you a good dinner. "Do not
fear the King," he says. "He is a fool who sits and
drinks grog all day. His only concem is deciding
who to put in the tower. His own knights laugh at
him, and he is more likely to fall from his throne
than you from your horse. Be off now and on to
Menie England, for great things await you there.
God speed and good fortune!"
Your energies are renewed by good food and
drink, and your horse too is ready to ride. You
thank your hostwarmly and ride off to new adven-
tures and a new life---almost a thousand years
before you are bom.
