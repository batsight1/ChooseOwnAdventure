You have no wish to risk sinking with the fd@rt
so you climb back down the ladder into the hold of
the shiphoping that somehow you will find grorr
way back to the cave. In your haste, you lose your
gripand fall. You reach out, but too late. You land
so hard you are knocked out. When you awaken,
you are in one of the passageways of the cave.
