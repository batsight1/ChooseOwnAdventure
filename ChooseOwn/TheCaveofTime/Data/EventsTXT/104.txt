When you tell him you come from the Twentieth
Century through the Cave of Time, Nick smiles.
Then you tell him a little about life in your own
time--about cars and planes, telephones and tele-
vision. He listens intently, with a big grin on his
face, as if you are telling the funniest story ever told.
"I'm so glad to meet you," Nick says. "I've
always wanted to know about life in the Twentieth
Century." He tries to look serious, but begins to
laugh, thinking it's all a joke.
"Seriously," you say,(since you know he will
never believe you)"I have no home.Do you know
of a place where I can stay?"
"l'm sure you can stay at our house," he says
warmly. "We have such a big family, one more
won't matter, but you must be willing to work in
the shop with the rest of us."
Since you feel you hardly have any other
choice, you accept his offer and feel grateful when
his parents give you a good dinner and a comfor-
table bed. Nick tells you, with much seriousness,
that you are living in the year 1718 in Boston, the
principal town in the British colony of Massachusetts.
You soon become one of the family. They are
good people and treat you well. But each day you
have to work long hours boiling soap and pouring
it into molds, waiting on customers and doing
errands for Nick's father, whom you have come to
know as Uncle Ted.
Your neighbor, Mr. Nelson, is a printer. He rec-
ently returned from England with a printing press
and letter type he bought there. The business in-
terests you, and you consider working as his ap-
prentice, but to do so you would have to sign
papers indenturing yourself to work faithfully for
him for six full years.
