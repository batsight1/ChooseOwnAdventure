You continue a long distance until you come to
the next tunnel. From there it is oniy a short dis-
tance until you reach the surface. An amazing sight
meets your eyes.
As far as you can see, the land looks like a
beautiful park, with soft, feathery grass and tower-
ing trees. Here and there are clusters of multi-
colored, dome-shaped buildings, connected by
ramps, terraces and walkways. Some people
dressed in simple khaki pants and shirts and tan
sneakers walk up to you. They do not understand
your language, nor you theirs. They look much
like the people of your time except that they are
unusually trim, muscular, and healthy looking,
and they are a good deal smaler than your own
people.
They take you inside a dome-shaped building
and show you electronic equipment that looks like
a computer. You notice a typewriter, so you sit at it
and type a message.
The computer prints out a reply. It apparently
has access to memory banks containing your lan-
guage. You soon discover you are living in the year
3742.
You dive down into the tunnel, hoping you can
make it back to an earlier time. Gratefully, you feel
cool, damp air coming up from the cave. You are
curious to try the next tunnel you come to, thinking
that it may show the state of the world just before it
began to burn up from the intensifying heat of the
dying sun, or that it might show what happened
afterw,ard! But you suspect that a tunnel further on
might be more likely to lead you back to your own
time.
