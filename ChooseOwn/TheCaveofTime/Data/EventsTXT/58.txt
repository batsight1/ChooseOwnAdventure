You take a deep breath, dive down, and swim
through the tunnel. There is light ahead. In a mo-
ment you surface in a beautiful lagoon. Thatched
cottages are nestled among the palm ilees that rim
the white sand beach. A warrn, softbreeze brings
the scent of jasmine and the sound of stuange
melodies from sonorous drums. Looking out to
the inlet from the sea, you can see a fleet of outrig
ger skiffs with multi-colored sails running into the
lagoons before the wind, their owners leaning
against the booms to hold the sails out.
You walk toward the village. Several hand-
some, brown-skinned people see you. Some of
them run away, but others walk toward you with
hands held up in salute. Two children, holding
garlands of flowers, mn up to you. Someone
calls-"Aloha!"
Soon you are sffing in frontof a huge beach fire,
cooking crabs and eating buana cake. Having
never had a visitor before, your hosts are happy to
see you. They welcome you into their society.
Gradually you leam their language. Jhe boys tell
you they are your brothers; the girls that they are
your sisters.
You enjoy life in this new paradise, but you still
wonder whether there might be a way to get back
to the Cave of Time. Your new friends are unable
to help. Perhaps if you joumeyed inland you could
find some who could. Your friends wam you
against trying, however. They tell you that you will
find only tenible jungles and rivers filled with
crocodiles.
