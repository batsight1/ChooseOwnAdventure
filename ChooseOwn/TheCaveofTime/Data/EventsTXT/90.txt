Inside the cave again, you feel depressed and
confused. Your eyes do not seem to be getting
used to the dim light. You cannot find any pas-
sageways leading to other times. You feel increas-
ing-ly drowsy. Soon you fall asleep on the cold clay
floor of the cave.
Sometime later you awaken. The cave is pitch
dark, but the bright light at the opening tells you
the sun is shining brightly outside. You walk out
into the daylight and, to your suprise and delight,
you see Snake Canyon, the trail, the grove of pine
trees nearby, everything just as it was when you 
entered the cave. Even the sun is in the same 
place, just about to pass behind the rim of the
canyon. Somehow you have returned to your own
time--or more precisely, the time it was before
you fell asleep in the cave.
You rub your eyes and start down the path back
to the Red Creek Ranch with a story to tell that no
one will believe, but that you will never forget'
