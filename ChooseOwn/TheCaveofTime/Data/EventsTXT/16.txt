 You resolutely trudge along a rocky ridge. It has
been cleared of whirling snow by the fierce wind,
which bites and blows against your body.
The world seems hansformed, and much for the
worse. You must find a house or a cabin-people
who can help you----or you will die.
fu you ponder your fate, you stumble and fall,
plunging into a deep crevasse. You black out and
later awaken, still shivering, but in a warmer place
at least. By the dim amber light, you can see that
somehow you have fallen back into one of the
chambers in the Cave of Time. A passageway
leads to the right, another to the left. Does one lead
to the future and one to the past?
