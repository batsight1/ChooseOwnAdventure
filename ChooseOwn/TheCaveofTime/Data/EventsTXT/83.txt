Much as you would like to see the inside of rhe
alien ship, you have no desire to be whisked off
into space. You step back to what you hope is a
safe distance and watch what happens. In a mo-
ment the portal closes, and almost instantly the
ship rises, silenfly, siraight up. Within a few min-
utes it is lost from view. You walk over to look
more closely at the primitive looking people sleep-
ing on the pallet. They begin to stir and stretch and
rub their eyes as if waking frorn a long sleep.
