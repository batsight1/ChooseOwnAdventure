There is something deadening about the perfect
future society that makes you want to retum to
your own time as quickly as possible. With a brief
word of farewell, you humT back to the tunnei,
climb down, and find a fork to the right that you
hope will take you toward the right time. Soon you
are climbing up toward the surface, excited about
the discovery you are about to make.
When you reach the surface, it is completely
dark. A chill wind is blowing. You sit resolutely
waiting for dawn so that you can see what kind of a
world you are in. Meanwhile, there is no way of
telling what time it is, either by your watch or by the
stars.
You hear loud, clicking sounds all around you,
mostly in the distance, but some quite close. As the
orange-pink glow of oncoming dawn lightens the
eastem sky, you see nearby the shape of a creature
that is the size of a sheep but has a very different
appearance.
You follow the tunnel downward a short dis-
tance, suddenly you are sliding. Your head stikes
something and you are knocked unconscious.
When you wake up, you find yourself by a small
lake, bordered by woods. A boy about twelve
years old is fishing nearby, but there is no one else
in sight. You go up and intuoduce yourself, hoping
you can find out what year it is without sounding
craa).
Fortunately, the boy is friendly and good na-
tured. He tells you his name is Nick Tyler and that
he lives on Birch Steet He works in his father's
business making candles and soapthe best in the
Colonies, he says.
