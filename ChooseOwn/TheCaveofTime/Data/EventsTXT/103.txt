The next day you call the Department of Zool-
ogy at a nearby university, where you are refened
to Dr. Henry Kam, a specialist in large reptiles. Dr.
Kam is skeptical about the egg but agrees to drive
to Red Creek Ranch immediately to see it.
By the time he arrives, you are feeling very
nervous. Suppose the egg is just made of plastic?
Your concern is heightened by his stern appear-
ance. He shakes hands brusquely with you and
your uncle and immediately asks to see the egg.
When you hand it to him, he says nothing while
he stares intenfly at it, holds it up to the lighf taps it
and scratches it with a pen knife. Then he holds it
to his ear.
Finally he smiles at you and genfly puts the egg
down. "lt's quite possible this is the egg of a
Plesiosaurus, an aquatic dinosaur of the late Juras-
sic period. It is highly unlikely it will ever hatch.
Even so, I would want to keep it in an incubator at
the Universrty for at least a year before breaking it
open. I'll . you know, of course, if anything develops."
A few weeks have passed since then and
whenever the phone rings you wonder if Dr. Karn
is calling.
