As you enter the cave, you see a flickering light
ahead and you smell smoke. You make your way
along a winding passageway and enter a large
chamber. Fires rise out of earthen vessels.
Several short, stocky people with straight black
hair and primitive faces are painting pictures on the
walls of the cave. They are dressed in animal skins.
In a corner of the cave ate beds of straw.
You stand, slighfly afraid, as the cave people
drop their work and run over and stare at you in
disbelief. The largest man is camTing a long vine.
He steps forward as though he might seize you and
tie you up.
