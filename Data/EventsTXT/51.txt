 Suddenly you hear voices shouting. You hide in
a thicket. An animal crashes through the brush. In
a moment some men rush by in pursuit, carring
spears and slings. You imagine thatyou must be in
an era long before the advent of civilization. You
follow an animal tail; it soon leads to a clearing,
and you lie down in the grass to rest. Looking up in
the sky, you see a long, thin, white steak. You rub
your eyes and look again. It seems to be a vapor
trail from a jet plane! You may be lMng in the
present time after all.
 After several days of wandering through the
jungle, you reach a settlement on the banks of a
large river. There is an airfield nearby, and within a
few weeks you are able to obtain a ride back to
civilization and return to your family--just a month
after you first entered the Cave of Time. You are
happy to be back home, but shocked at how much
older everyone looks. And they express the
greatest surprise that after eleven years you
haven't changed a bit!
