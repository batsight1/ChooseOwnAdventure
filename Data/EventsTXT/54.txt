 You enter the next tunnel you come to. It be-
comes smaller and smaller until you must crawl.
You continue this way for almost an hour. Finally,
your faith is justified, for you smell a frsh breeze
blowing across a filed of new-mown hay.
 A moment later you are blinking your eyes in the
bright sunlight, looking at a beautiful meadow nes-
tled between gentle hills. A dozen or more cows
are grazing near a meandering stream. In the dis-
tance is a dirt road. A farmer is sitting on a cart filled
with hay. A dapple-gray horse is pulling the cart
toward a big red barn in the distance. From the
other direction you hear the mournful hooting of a
train whistle.
 You turn around and see that you are only a few
hundred feet from the railroad tracks. A train is
chugging around the bend, puffs of black smoke
rising from its coal-fired steam engine. You are out
of the Ice Age, all right, but not exactly in your own
time.
 The train slows down as it approaches you and
you smile as you see the reason why--a cow is
standing on the hacks just ahead, looking as if it
would not move for anything. The train pulls to a
stop, and a man jumps down from the cab, waving
a coal shovel at the cow, which waits almost until
the man is upon her before strolling back into the
pasture. At that moment you realize you could
easily climb onto the back of the train.
