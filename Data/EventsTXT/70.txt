One day when the sun is bright and the water as
warm as it's likely to get, you take an old skiff and
row to Beatty's Point. You pull your boat up on the
rocky shoal that marks the cave. You dive again
and again along the rock wall that drops into the
depths until you find the entrance. You swim a few
feet inside and find you can get up to the surface
inside an enormous cavern, most of it filled by an
underground lake.
You reach the shore and walk along the
lakeside, deeper and deeper into the cavern,
which is lit by a mysterious blue light. Then, ahead,
you see what you had hoped to find__a tunnel thal
surely must lead to the Cave of Time. Nearby in
the sand are three eggs as large as footballs. You
pick one up and carry it into the tunnel. After
walking awhile, the air becomes hard to breathe.
You begin to feel dizzy and fall unconscious to the
ground, still clutchinng the enormous egg.
You are awakened by a fresh breeze blowing
toward you. You dizzrly get to your feet, pick up
the egg, and humy toward the fresh air----outdoors
again in Snake Canyon! Everything is as you re-
member it and in a few hours you are walking up to
the ranch, where your uncle says he is surprised
you got back so quickly!
When you tell what has happened to you, no
one at the ranch believes it, though they are fasci-
nated by your enorrnous egg.
"Maybe we'll believe that egg is real-and be-
lieve your story-if it will hatch a monster," your
uncle says, "or if you break it open to show us
what's inside."
