 "Ah, you are a shrewd one," the old man says.
"You'll try to get two loaves of bread, rather than
settle for one. Well, I'll show you one other time,
and, if you don't like it, just say so, and I'll return
you to your own time, if there is time to do so. Take
the tunnel to your left."
 You follow his direction, walk through the tun-
nel, and come out onto a city street". Instantly you
realize there is a war going on. Bombs and rockets
are exploding all around you. You cry out to the
old man, asking to be retumed to the Cave of
Time, but there is no time left.
