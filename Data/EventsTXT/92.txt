 You continue a long distance until you come to
the next tunnel. From there it is oniy a short dis-
tance until you reach the surface. An amazing sight
meets your eyes.
 As far as you can see, the land looks like a
beautiful park, with soft, feathery grass and tower-
ing trees. Here and there are clusters of multi-
colored, dome-shaped buildings, connected by
ramps, terraces and walkways. Some people
dressed in simple khaki pants and shirts and tan
sneakers walk up to you. They do not understand
your language, nor you theirs. They look much
like the people of your time except that they are
unusually trim, muscular, and healthy looking,
and they are a good deal smaller than your own
people.
 They take you inside a dome-shaped building
and show you electronic equipment that looks like
a computer. You notice a typewriter, so you sit at it
and type a message.
 The computer prints out a reply. It apparently
has access to memory banks containing your lan-
guage. You soon discover you are living in the year
3742.
