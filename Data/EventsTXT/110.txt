 You work hard to improve your skills as a
printer. Within a few years, with the help of some
friends, you are able to raise enough money to go
into business on your own.
 Your printing business thrives, and after awhile
you start your own newspaper. It begins to look as
if the Eighteenth Century is a pretty good time for
you to be alive.
