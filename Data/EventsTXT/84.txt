 You run up the hill and out of sight before any of
the primitive people awaken. You must find an
entrance to the Cave of Time. You search in the
high rocky ground for some opening. Hours go by;
dusk is fast approaching. Just as you are about to
give up hope, you spy the entrance to a cave under
a rock ledge. You eagerly step inside and have
only a moment's awareness that it is the den of a
saber-toothed tiger.
