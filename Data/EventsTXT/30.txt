 Riding on a mammoth might be fun if you were
not cold and hungry and lost, but where would it
take you? You continue walking, your spirits sink-
ing. Just as you feel ready to sit down and cry, you
see an opening in the ground. You crawl in on
your hands and knees. It might provide some
warmth, and it might lead to the Cave of Time.
 You find yourself in a tunnel. There are other
tunnels branching off. You feel sure now you are in
the Cave of Time. You are eager to take the next
tunnel to the surface, but you want to tavel a long
way fonvard in time. Maybe you should take a
tunnel further on.
