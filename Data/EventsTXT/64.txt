 Swimming through the underwater tunnel may
be the only way to get out of the grotto, but the risk
of drowning seems too great. You explore the
rocks in the grotto and think about how you might
possibly get up through the roof.
 Suddenly a voice calls, "Hello." You whirl
around and notice for the first time, huddled in ihe
corner, a woman with sparkling blue eyes and a
mysterious smile. She is sitting crosslegged,
propped against a rock which is shaped in a way
that gives her a comfortable seat. In her hands she
is holding a flute, and as you stare in amazement
she plays an unfamiliar melody with a sweetness
and purity of tone such as you have never heard.
 "Hello," you reply. "Tell me--who are you and
how can we get out of here?"
 "Sit down," she says, "and relax. You have all
the time in the world."
 'What do you mean?" you reply. "I am
trapped. I slid down from the Cave of Time and I
want to get out."
 "Believe me, " the woman says, "there's no way
to get out; but do not be concemed. It is a beautiful
place and you can be very happy here."
 "But we'll starve. How long have you been
here?" you exclaim.
 "Forever and not at all," she replies, "for this is
the part of the cave which leads neither to the past
nor to the future. Here, time does not exist, so, of
course, you will never be hungry or bored, and,
although you can never get out, you will be here
for no time at all."
