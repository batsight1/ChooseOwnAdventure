 You follow the tunnel downward a short dis-
tance, suddenly you are sliding. Your head stikes
something and you are knocked unconscious.
 When you wake up, you find yourself by a small
lake, bordered by woods. A boy about twelve
years old is fishing nearby, but there is no one else
in sight. You go up and intuoduce yourself, hoping
you can find out what year it is without sounding
crazy.
 Fortunately, the boy is friendly and good na-
tured. He tells you his name is Nick Tyler and that
he lives on Birch Street. He works in his father's
business making candles and soap--the best in the
Colonies, he says.
