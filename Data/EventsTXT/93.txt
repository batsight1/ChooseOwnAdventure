 You dive down into the tunnel, hoping you can
make it back to an earlier time. Gratefully, you feel
cool, damp air coming up from the cave. You are
curious to try the next tunnel you come to, thinking
that it may show the state of the world just before it
began to burn up from the intensifying heat of the
dying sun, or that it might show what happened
afterward! But you suspect that a tunnel further on
might be more likely to lead you back to your own
time.
