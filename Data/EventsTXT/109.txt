 You go to work in Mr. Nelson's shop and soon
become proficient in the art of printing. But after
awhile, you become increasingly unhappy. Mr.
Nelson refuses to raise your wages or give you a
chance to own part of the business. There are no
jobs available for you in Boston, so you decide to
move to Philadelphia, where you have heard there
is a greater demand for printing.
 Happily, Mr. Nelson agrees to release you from
your indenture, and by selling almost all your pos-
sessions, you are able to raise enough money to
engage passage on a coastal schooner. After a long
and stormy voyage down the coast, your ship
docks early on a Sunday morning at the Market
Street wharf in Philadelphia.
 You are tired and hungry and you use some of
your last money to buy a loaf of bread. Out of
curiosity, you follow some well-dressed people
into the Quaker meeting house. The people seat
themselves, but, following custom, no one speaks.
It is so peaceful you fall sound asleep. When you
awaken, the Quakers welcome you. One family
gives you lodging and, fortunately, you are able to
get a job with one of the two printers in the town.
