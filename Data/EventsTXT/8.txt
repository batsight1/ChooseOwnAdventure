 As it gets lighter, you realize you can't be on the 
right track. The canyon seems shallower than it 
was. The river bed is strewn with boulders that 
were never there before. The cold wind chills you 
to the bone; yet it's the middle of summer. As you 
climb to higher ground to get a better view, you 
notice patches of snow. From the top of a ridge 
you survey a barren plain, frozen lakes, and, in the 
distance, a massive range of snow-covered moun-
tains. You begin to realize you are not merely 
lost---you are lost in time, and you have somehow 
been transported to an Ice Age that occured many 
thousands of years ago.
 You walk toward one of the cliffs that borders 
the canyon, seeking shelter from the wind, and 
notice an entrance to another cave. You are 
tempted to go inside, but you feel you should keep 
moving in hopes of somehow reaching familiar 
country.
