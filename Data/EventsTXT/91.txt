 Reasoning that you can always find your way
back into the cave when you want to, you decide
to explore the world in which you have found
yourself.
 You make your way along a rock ledge over-
looking the plains and lakes, taking care to keep
your bearings so you can find your way back to the
cave.
 By now you are getting very hungry. You know
that you are in the age of reptiles--at least 100
million years ago--and that mammals may not yet
have appeared on earth. There will be no rabbits
or deer to hunt, though the lakes may contain fish.
You wonder how dinosaur eggs taste.
 You follow a wide path through the fern trees.
When you round the first bend, you find yourself
face to face with the horrible Triceratops, a great
gray monster almost hidden behind its shields and
horns. It looks at you curiously with dull brown
eyes. You turn, run, and crash into a tree trunk--
one that wasn't there before!
 The bark feels like leather. You look up to see
how high it is--into the jaws of Tyrannosaurus
Rex.
