 You pack up your few belongings. The one you
prize most is a knife carved from the tusk of a
wooly mammoth. You wave goodbye to your
friends and trudge through the snow, trying to
retrace your steps back to the Cave of Time.
Though the wind is colder than ever, the bright sun
stirs your hopes.
 You have become much more rugged from liv-
ing with the cave people, and your crude animal-
skin clothes keep you surprisingly warm. You find
your way down into the canyon and in a few hours
reach the entrace to the cave, now almost cov-
ered with blowing snow.
 You are exhausted from the long trek, and your
eyes are watering from the cold wind. You hardly
notice the large, gray shape only a few yards from
the entrance to the cave until you hear the deep,
guttural grown of a wolf. Now you stare directly into
its cold, cruel eyes. You feel that at your slightest
movement it will spring at you. You must think
what to do before you move. You probably could 
outrun the wolf to the cave. It might hesitate before
following you---and give you enough time to
escape---or you could try to knife the wolf in the
throat as it leaps at you.
