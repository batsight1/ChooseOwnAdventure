 "I'm sorry to have intruded upon your royal
domain, Your Majesty." you say humbly, tying to
think up a good story as fast as you can. "It is true,
sire, I have been badly mistreated by my wicked
stepfather, with whom I live, and I place myself
under your wise and just protection."
 "Who is this wicked stepfather and where does
he live?" the King asks. "If he is wicked enough,
we may want him to be one of our knights," he
adds, laughing, as do all the courtiers.
 "He lives beyond that hill," you say, pointing
toward a high wooded ridge, "and his name is
Smith."
 The King laughs once again. "Then your step
father must be a fish," he says, "for beyond yon-
der hill is Loch Ness."
