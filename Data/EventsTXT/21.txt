 You turn and walk back out of the cave. It
should be dawn by now, but, as you grope your
way toward the entrance, you can't see any light
coming into the cave. You press against the walls,
feeling for an opening. Your hands pass across
something cold, wet, and hard. Ice! The entance
is sealed by it. Blocks of ice protrude into the cave.
 You step back, feeling confused and helpless.
You wish ilwerejust a dream. You retrace your
steps a way, trying to think clearly. You know that
your only chance to get out of the cave is to follow
one of the two branches before you.
