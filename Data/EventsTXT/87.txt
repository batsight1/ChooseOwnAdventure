 You have no desire to be involved in building
the Great Wall of China, or, for that matter, to be
taken to another planet by aliens. You walk back
into the crevasse, hoping io find a tunnel that
might lead to another time. You walk along ihe
bottom of the crevasse and reach an opening on
the other side of the ridge, where you half expect
to see the rolling countryside, the stream and the
space ship that were there before.
 Instead, the crevasse leads to the ocean! Like a
bad dream, where the scene suddenly changes
into something entirely different, you find that the
hills have become waves, which stlrround you so
that the rock you are standing on is only a reef
protruding a few yards above the wind-swept seas.
And there seems to be no escape, because, for all
you can tell, you are standing on the only land in
the world"
