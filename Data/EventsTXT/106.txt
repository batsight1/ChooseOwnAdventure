 You do your best to make up a story about how
you ran away from home, but Nick sees that you
are not telling him the tn:th. While you're talking,
he packs up his fishing gear, says goodbye, and
walks off.
 Once he is out of sight, you start down the road
and, after a mile or so, reach a settled area. While
you are standing near a church, wondering what to
do next, a constable approaches and asks where
you're from. This time you try to explain what
really happned. After listening awhile, he arrests
you for disorderly conduct and locks you up in the
local jail.
 Later in the day, a big, stupid-looking guard
comes to bring you a ration of soup and bread. He
is fascinated by your strange clothes and by the
rumors he has heard about you. After opening the
door to your cell, he hands you your food and
stands back and looks at you curiously.
 "They say you're in league with the devil," he
says. "Is it so?"
