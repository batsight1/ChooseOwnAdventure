 You walk along the right-hand passageway for a
long distance, praying that you can find a tunnel
that wiil lead to your own time. You choose one of 
the many tunnels you see and follow it. Instead of
rising to the surface, you enter a brightly-lighted
chamber, in the center of which is a bearded, old
man seateci in a chair.
 "Welcorne," he says, as if he has been expect-
ing you.
 "Thank you," you reply. "Can you help me find
my way back to my own time?"
 The old man srniles. "First of all," he says, "tell
me why you want to return to your own time
instead of another time."
