 "I'd like to stay on till Gettysburg," you say.
 "Well, that's fine," the President replies. "Why
don't you sit across from me? I have to write out a
little talk I'm giving there, and, while I'm doing
that, you think about what you're going to make of
your life, because you can't spend all your time
riding on trains, after all."
 You nod in agreement and sit quietly watching
the President scribbiing some lines on an en-
velope. After awhile he looks up from his writing
and you look each other in the eyes.
 "You have a great future," he says abrupfly.
 "How can you tell," you ask.
 "By looking at your face."
 "Just by that?"
 "Just so."
 As you are talking, you notice two elaborately
dressed men approaching from the end of the car.
They whisper a few words to the President. He
excuses himself, shakes hands with you, and tells
one of his soldiers to see that you are provided for
in Gettysburg.
 When you arrive at Gettysburg, one of the sol-
diers takes you to a family who welcomes you
warmly and agrees to put you up for a while, if you
will help them out with their farm.
 You find it amazing to be living in a time with no
cars, radios, television, record players, or even
telephones. It's peaceful---at least when there is
not a war going on--but you feel homesick. You
feel the great future the President predicted for you
lies in your own time, and you resolve to find your
way back to the Cave of Time.
