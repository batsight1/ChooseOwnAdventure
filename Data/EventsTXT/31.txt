 You take the first tunnel and follow it on and on
until you begin to wonder whether you are going
around in circles. What can this mean? Perhaps
time itself is slowing. You are nearing the point of
exhaustion, and begin to feel very cold. You see an
opening up ahead and stars shining. You step
outside on barren ground. It is bitler cold. Even
though there is no wind, you know you will freeze
if you stay more than a few minutes---maybe not
that long, for the air seems very thin, as if you were
on top of a very high mountain. You find yourself
gasping for breath. You look up at the clear, cold
night sky studded with thousands of stars. Among
the stars, you notice a disk the size of the sun that
gives off a dim red light like a dying ember.
