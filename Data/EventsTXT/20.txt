 The tunnel to the left winds around like a spiral,
passing several more funnels. You turn down one
of them, then climb steeply. In a few moments you
climb through a hole and emerge in a desert. The
weather is extremely hot---certainly over 100 de-
grees, but the sun is just about to set, so it should
be getting cooler. In the distance is a range of
mountains, which look extremely high, yet are
bare of snow. You have no idea whether you are in
the past, the future, or the present. Then you see
something that fascinates and disturbs you. The
sand seems to be fused into yellowish glass as if
heated in a furnace. As you examine the sand
more closely, you feelthe air getiing even hotter.
Suddenly you realize the sun is not setting, but
rising! The noontime temperature must be more
than life can stand. As the sun rises higher, you feel
a blistering wave of heat. The light is almost blind-
ing. Could it be that you are witnessing the end of
the world?
