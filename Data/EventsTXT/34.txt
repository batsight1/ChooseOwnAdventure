 You make your way along in the dim light.
Ahead of you is a ladder. You take hold of it and
begin to climb. Suddenly you hear a tenible grind-
ing, crunching noise. The ladder shudders. You
hold on tight for a few minutes after the noise
subsides. Then you continue up the ladder and a
moment later pull yourself out into the crisp, cold
night air. Lights are glowing all around you. In
front of you is a large slab of ice. You feel a strange
motion as if the ground is moving. When you
touch the ground with your hand, you feel wood.
Not far from you is a railing. Beyond it---the sea!
Above you are stars more numerous and brilliant
than you have seen before. You realize you are on
the deck of a very large ship.
 Not far from you, hanging on a hook, is an
enorrnous life preserver. Stenciled on it in black
letters is the word TITANIC. You know there was
only one ship that ever bore that name, that it
made only one voyage, that it struck a huge
iceberg, and that three hours later it was resting on
the bottom of the Atlantic.
 As you walk along the deck of the Titanic, you
realize that below the water line thousands of gal-
lons of water per minute are pouring into the for-
ward compartment.The people don't seem to
realize what's happening. The sea is a as calm as
glass. The band on the deck below you is playing a
waltz. Several men in long black coats and women
in fur jackets are walking close by.
 "Goodness," one woman says, "I can't under-
stand why the captiain has stopped the ship. If we
are late docking in New York, I'm going to lodge a
complaint with the owners."
