 You go up to the base of the wall where the
people are working. When they see you, they
imagine you are a spy from some unknown tribe.
Some guards capture you and force you to sit on a
pile of rocks while they talk about you.
 After a while they point to one of the ladders.
Two other people force you to start handing up
rocks. You realize that you have been conscripted
to work building a wall twenty feet high, twelve feet
wide, and 1,400 miles long. You calculate it will
take about ten billion rocks to build the wall. You
wonder how many of them you will lift before you
can escape--if you ever do.
