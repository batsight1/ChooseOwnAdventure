 "Off to the tower," the Kingshouts. Two knights 
leap forward, drag you out of the chamber, and,
with spears at your back, force you to climb forty-
eight stone steps to the tower prison---a tiny cylin-
drical room with one small window looking out
over the moat and pasture land beyond. The only
fumiture is a bed of straw.
 You realize you are back in the early days of
feudal Europe, where the only laws are the King's
whims. You have no idea how long he intends to
keep you in the tower. There is one possibility of
escape. The water in the moat, about twenty-five
feet almost direcfly below your window, is quite
deep. If youjump out far enough, you should land
in the deep water and not be hurt.
