 You follow the left passageway. It leads upward
to the surface. Before you, a grassy meadow
slopes down to a clear, fast-flowing stream; be-
yond it are pine-covered foothills stretching in the
distance toward snow-covered peaks. You might 
be in Wyoming in your own time, but, whatever
time it is, the world you see appears to be a hospi-
table one.
 You notice a herd of buffalo grazing. But
nowhere can you see a house, or fence, or road, or
any sign of human presence. It is possible you are
living hunders, perhaps thousands, of years ago.
 You gaze upward. One of the puffy, white
cumulus clouds is moving in a strange fahsion. It is
descending! A spaceship is landing right before
your eyes, only a few hundred yards away!
