 You can see no future for yourself .with these
primitive peopie, so yorl run back towarci the Cave
of Time. Fortunately, they do not follow you, and
you are able to find your way.
 By the time you re-enter the cave, you are hun-
gry and exhausted. The light is dimmer than be-
fore and you grope your way along, looking for a
passageway. You stumble and fall headfirst down
agreeably. You look up and see daylight ahead. A
minute later, you walk out of the cave into warm,
moist air near a foest of leafy trees. A bird flies by.
You don't know when it is, but it looks pleasant 
enough
