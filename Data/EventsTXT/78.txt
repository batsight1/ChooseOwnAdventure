 You'd rather spend the rest of your life search-
ing for an entrance to the Cave of Time than settle
for the placid life of a fishing village. So you bid
your new friends farewell and set out over the
countryside, headed south for London. Your goal
is to find a ship to take you to America, though you
know America hasn't been discovered yet, for
somehow you must find your way back to Red
Creek Canyon and the Cave of Time.
 A few hours later, as you are walking on a road
along the edge of the forest, some burly men ride
out from behind a clump of trees.
 "We've got you," one shouts. "You're the one
who escaped from the tower, aren't you?" They
force you upon a horse and ride at top speed
toward the castle.
 "The penalty for escaping from the tower is
hanging," one of them tells you.
 You find out he is right.
