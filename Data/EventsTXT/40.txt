 You cautiously approach the spaceship and, to
your amazement, see that it is resting a foot or so
above the ground, without any visible mechanism
keeping it aloft. There are no engines, rocket
exhausts, port holes, landing gear, antennae, or
any equipment you might imagine a spaceship
would need. You realize it must be the product of a
supremely advanced civilization.
 Trusting that such people have learned to be
loving toward others, you approach the ship. A
portal slides open, but all you can see within is
shimmering blue light. A large cube is thrust out
through the portal and lowered to the ground by
mechanical arms. The top of the cube is with-
drawn, leaving a pallet on which lie the sleeping
forms of three men and three women, dressed in
shrouds of animal skin. Their bodies and features
remind you of pictures you have seen depicting
the earliest men on earth. You have an impulse to
jump aboard the spaceship before the portal
closes.
