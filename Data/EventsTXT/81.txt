 You feel yourself slowly regaining conscious-
ness. You are in your bed at Red Creek Ranch,
looking up at Uncle Howard. Standing nearby is a
friend of his who is a doctor.
 "You took quite a bad fall climbing on those
rocks up in the canyon," Uncle Howard says.
 "Doc Parsons tells me he doesn't know why you
didn't break any bones. We were real worried
about you--thought you got lost in one of those
caves up there."
 You feel a bit dizzy and weak, so you just smile
and say nothing. Probably no one would believe
you anyway. Years later, though, you write a book
about your adventures in the Cave of Time.
