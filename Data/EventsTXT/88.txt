 You walk back through the cavem, wondering if
the entrance will still be blocked by ice. This time,
though, you are greeted by a warm breeze. Sun-
light is shining on the ground near the entrance,
and you walk outside.
 Squinting your eyes in the bright light, you see a
world totally different from the one you know. You
are on a hillside. For miles and miles you can see
grassy plains speckled with lakes. Nearby is a forest
of towering ferns, swaying in the wind. The world
before you seems strangely quiet, except for the
faint rumbling of distant thunder. Suddenly, the
thunder seems much closer--and louder. The
thundering sound is moving through the ferns.
You run up the hill looking for a place to hide. A
huge shadow passes on the ground. Above you,
soaring through the air, is a creature larger than
any bird you have seen.
 Now it is clear what has been happening. The
cave is a crack in the universe--a place outside
space-time. Once inside its tunnels you could find
yourself at any place, at any time. If you enter
again you might be sent to a place from which you
could never escape. Yet that is your only hope of
returning to your own place and time.
