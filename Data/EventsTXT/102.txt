 You sit down and rest your chin in your hands,
unable to believe the fate that has befallen you. To
live forever in a timeless world seems worse than
death.
 "Well, to tell the truth, there is a way to get back
to your own time," the woman finally says, "but, if
you follow it, you will not be able to live forever."
 "I don't care," you say. "Show me the way."
 "Very well," she says, shaking her head in dis-
belief. "Dive under the rock ledge beneath me and
swim through the tunnel you will find there. You
will come up in your own time. Don't worry, it's
only a few yards. You can make it."
 You take a last look around, wave good-bye
and dive. A few seconds later you surface in a
pond just inside the entrance of the Cave of Time.
You swim to shore and run out through the cave
entrance into the open air, almost crashing into
your Uncle Howard, who has come looking for
you.
 "You're late for dinner," he says. "We won-
dered what happened to you. You ought to keep
better track of the time."
