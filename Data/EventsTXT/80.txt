 "Since you can't find your way to your own
time," you say, "perhaps we can find my time."
You lead her back a short distance, until you
come to an unusually wide tunnel. You stop, and
Louisa looks at you inquiringly. "Let's try this
one," you say.
 After haveling almost an hour, the two of you
smile with joy to see light ahead, and you soon
come out of the tunnel and stand on reddish
sandy ground, surveying a saucer-shaped terrain.
The air is as fresh and clear as on a crisp, fall day.
You guess that you may be in the crater of an
extinct volcano. Suddenly, there is a thundering
roar behind you. Louisa and you run from a
landslide that buries the tunnel leading back to
the Cave of Time.
 "I wonder what year it is?" Louisa asks, after
the two of you have collected your wits.
 For the first time you look up at the sun. It is
four times as large as the sun you knew, though
not as bright. It is almost directly overhead, yet its
color is a rusty red.
 "I don't know the answer," you'reply, "but
from what I've read about astronomy, I would
guess it's the year 2,000--plus about four billion
years."
