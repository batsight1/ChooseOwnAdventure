 You climb up the steps between the last car and
the caboose just as the train begins to start up
again. When you open the doorto the car, you are
surprised to see soldiers in blue uniforms holding
old-fashioned rifles. They advance upon you. One
of them strides past you to see if anyone else
followed you.
 "How did you know this was the President's
car?" the first soldier asks you.
 "What President?" you reply.
 Then, to your amazement, you get the answer
to your question, for the very tall bearded man
walking down the aisle could be no one else but
Abraham Lincoln.
 "That's all right," the Presidenttells the soldiers,
"I could use some company right now. You may
stay until we reach Gettysburg," he says to you.
"But maybe you should get off at Parkersville. I
know of some good people there who will help
you out."
