 Your hosts give you a fine bedroom with large
windows overlooking the park on one side. On
another wall is a beautiful painting of the Califomia
seacoast. When you push a button, the painting
folds up to the ceiling, revealing a large screen.
Your room contains a computer terminal that en-
ables you to select any movie or other program
you desire from over 10,000 possibilities. There
are even films where you are the main character
and you can make choices as to what will happen
next in the story. Then, if you don't like the way the
plot is working out, you can go back to an earlier
point and make different choices from then on.
 On your terminal you can also play games and
flash pages of books or magazines on the screen.
You can live quite well without even getting out of
bed.
 Eventually you go exploring. You meet other
people, but you find none of them very interesting,
so you spend most of your time watching the
greatest movies of all time. Gradually you settle
into your new life. One thing disturbs you. No one
has made any new movies in the last 300 years.
