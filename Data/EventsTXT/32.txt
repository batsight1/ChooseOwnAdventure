 After following the passageway for a consider-
able distance, you enter a very large tunnel that
seems as likely as any to lead you back to your own
time. You continue along and soon notice that the
floor of the funnel is becoming sandier. Perhaps
you are coming to a beach. Then the sand gives
way under your feet; you slide through sand and
rising dust. You cannot stop yourself--it is too
steep; then there is nothing under your feet, and a
moment later you land in deep water. You swim to
the surface and catch your breath. You are in an
underwater grotto, which seems completely
sealed off except for a portion of its roof that is
open to the blue sky. You swim to a large, smooth
rock sloping into the water.
 The sand is white, and the water transparent.
The rocks are made of crystalline material of the
most delicate shades of blue. For a moment you
are overwhelmed by the beauty of the scene be-
fore you can escape from it. There is no way of climbing
out through the opening in the roof.
 You dive down in hopes of finding an underwa-
ter passageway that might lead to freedom, and
you find one! But could you swim through it before
running out of air?
