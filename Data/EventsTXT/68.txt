 Could you change history and save hundreds of
lives by waming the captain that the "unsinkable"
Titanic is destined for the bottom of the Atlantic?
You see some stairs leading to a higher deck, and
you run up them.
 A steward is standing near the top. "You can't
come up here," he cries. But you dart past him and
run toward the forward part of the ship. You dash
up another set of stairs, where you find yourself at
the starboard wing of the bridge. The gray-
bearded captain is standing only a few feet away,
looking out to sea through his binoculars at a ship
on the horizon.
 "Captain," you call out. "You may not realize it,
but this ship will sink in only two or three hours."
He turns and looks at you gravely. "l know," he
says softly. "But we are going to fire dishess rock-
ets. That ship out there--the Califormian--should
respond to help us."
 "They will not respond, Captain," you tell him.
"They can'tbelieve the Tifonic could be in touble,
even though they see your rockets. Your only
hope is to put your strongest men in a lifeboat and
have them row toward the Califormian at top
speed--firing rockets as they approach."
 "Great heavens, you have bold ideas," the cap-
tain replies, "but I need every man I have to lower
our lifeboats and keep order among the passen-
gers. I can't believe the Califormian will not come
when they see our rockets.
 "Now go to the deck below. Mr. Lightoller will
see that you have a place in a lifeboat."
 With that the captain turns and stuides away,
giving orders to an officer nearby. You sadly return
down the stairs and wait in line for one of the
places in a lifeboat.
 Two hours later, you sit huddled in the crowded
boat, shivering in the cold breeze, and watch the
great Titanic slip beneath the waves--with 1,500
people still aboard--together with your only hope
of finding your way back to the Cave of Time.
