 You've hiked through Snake Canyon once be-
fore while visiting your Uncle Howard at Red
Creek Ranch, but you never noticd any cave 
entrance. It looks as though a recent rock slide has 
uncovered it.
 Though the late afternoon sun is striking the 
opening of the cave, the interioir remains in total
darkness. You step inside a few feet, trying to get 
an idea of how bit it is. As your eyes become used 
to the dark, you see what looks like a tunnel ahead, 
dimly lit by some kind of phosphorescent material 
on its walls. The tunnel walls are smooth, as if they 
were shaped by running water. After twenty feet or 
so, the tunnel curves. You wonder where it leads. 
You venture in a bit further, but you feel nervous 
being alone in such a strange place. You turn and 
hurry out. 
 A thunderstorm may be coming, judging by 
how dark it looks outside. Suddenly you realize the 
sun has long since set, and the landscape is lit only 
by the pale light of the full moon. You must have 
fallen asleep and woken up hours later. But then 
you remember something even more strange. Just 
last evening, the moon was only a slim crescent in 
the sky. 
 You wonder how long you've been in the cave. 
You are not hungry. You don't feel you have been 
sleeping. You wonder whether to try to walk back 
home by moonlight or whether to wait for dawn, 
rather than risk losing your footing on the steep 
and rocky trail.
