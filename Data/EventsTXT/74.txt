 The idea that the Loch Ness monster goes into
the Cave of Time for a hundred years or so before
returning seems preposterous. And, even if it does,
it seems very doubtful you could dive down deep
enough to find the underwater entrance. So you
resign yourself to making a living fishing the waters
of Loch Ness.
 You find it a tolerable, though not very interest-
ing, life. You particularly like rowing out in your
skiff in the early morning mists and watching the
pale, red sun struggling to shine through the haze.
That's what you are doing one day when you feel a
tremendous thump under your boat, the stem is
heaved high into the air, and you are hurled over
the bow and into the jaws of the monster.
 Some of your friends find the wreckage of your
boat later in the day and, throughout the village,
people say to each other-"The monster has re-
tumed again."
