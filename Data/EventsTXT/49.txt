 Slowly you unsheath your knife and then run for
the entrance. The wolf is after you like a shot. It
leaps and tears your bearskin coat. While the wolf
is regaining its balance, you run into the cave and
toward the left tunnel. The wolf runs after you.
You look over your shoulder and lose your foot-
ing. Instead of falling on the ground, you feel
yourself sliding down a long, steep chute. Far
above, the wolf howls with frustation. You land in
a heap at the bottom of a pit--shaken but un-
harmed. There is a dark passageway to the left.
You toss in a stone and, after what seems like a long
time, you hear a splash far below. Fortunately,
there is another passageway to the right, which is
dimly lit by phosphorescent light.
