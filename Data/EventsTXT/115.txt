 You jump aboard and find yourself in a sealed
chamber. The walls surrounding you remind you
of the inside of a bathtub. It occurs to you that the
beings who control this spaceship have some
means of manipulating time. Could it be that the
Cave of Time is their creation? fu you are thinking
these thoughts, you become increasingly drowsy.
In a moment you are asleep.
 You awaken in darkness, wondering if you may
be traveling through space in the alien ship. There
is light coming toward you from one direction and
you get up and walk toward it. Then gou realize
you are looking through the opening of your cave.
You hurry out and, to your joy, find Snake Can-
yon just as you remembered it. You are back in
your own time.
 It's a long while before you feel like visiting
Snake Canyon again. When you do, you find the
opening to the Cave of Time has been covered
over by a massive rock slide, and, you think to
yourself that may be just as well.
