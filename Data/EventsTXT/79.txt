 You have no wish to risk sinking with the Titanic
so you climb back down the ladder into the hold of
the ship--hoping that somehow you will find your
way back to the cave. In your haste, you lose your
grip and fall. You reach out, but too late. You land
so hard you are knocked out. When you awaken,
you are in one of the passageways of the cave.
