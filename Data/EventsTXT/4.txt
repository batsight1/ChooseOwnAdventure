As you start walking back toward the ranch, you
notice the trail seems very diflerent than you re-
member it, though of course moonlight can play
tricks on your eyes. But you suddenly realize you
are not walking on the hail at all, but on what
seems to be a dried-up river bed. You hurry back
to the cave entrance. You look around you and
realize the whole landscape has changed. While
you were in the cave, torrents of water have
washed out the trail; yet there is not so much as a
puddle left. You shiver. It is cold, much colder than
it should be at this time of year. You take a jacket
out of your backpack and put it on, but you are still
freezing.
 At least the world about you seems brighter. It's
getting light in the east. The sun will soon be up.
You look at your watch. It has run down, though
you wound it only a few hours ago. Nothing seems
to make sense anymore.
 You know you should get back to the ranch as
quickly as possible; yet somehow you feel the only
way to change things back to the way they were is
to re-enter the cave.
