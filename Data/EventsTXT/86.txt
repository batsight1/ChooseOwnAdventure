 You walk on and on, hoping the passageway
will lead you to your own time. You soon come to
a tunnel that leads into a dark, musty room re-
sembling the cellar of a large house. There are a
great many people huddled in groups, sitting on
blankets in complete darkness save for the light of
a few flickering candles. You hear the dismal wail
of a siren. Near the center of the room an old-
fashioned radio sits on the table playing a mixture
of classical music and static. Then the sirens stop,
the ground shakes, and you hear a tremendous
explosion nearby, then another further away, then
another so close that a wall and half the ceiling
come crashing down in a piie of rubble, blocking
the tunnel. You and the others scramble to the
opposite side of the room, coughing and gasping
in the dust-filled air.
 You are about to begin a new life. The year is
l94O; the place, London.
