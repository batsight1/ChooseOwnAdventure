 You work your way back to the mammoth's
rump and slide down, landing hard on the icy
ground, where you lie aching and bruised, while
the mammoth lumbers on. Suddenly it disap-
ears, driven off the cliff. The hunters are shouting
and cheering. Some of them come up to you.
They are short and muscular, their jaws jut out,
and they have bright squinting eyes. Their black
hair hangs down to their shoulderss. They are
dressed in animal skins.
 You look up helplessly, wondering what they
will do to you, but in an instant you can see they
will not hurt you. They help you up and carry you
back to their cave and feed you steaming broth. It
tastes awful, but makes you feel much better. You
soon learn that the cave people will accept you as
one of them, because you have--without realizing
it--performed the sacred rite of their culture by
riding bravely on the back of a mammoth.
 Life is hard and simple with the cave people,
and sometimes you long for your family, your
friends, and your own time again; yet your new life
is as exciting and happy as you could wish for.
