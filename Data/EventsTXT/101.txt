 With considerable trepidation you slide down
the tunnel. You mean to turn off at one of the side
passageways that might take you back to your own
time, but you are too exhausted to search for the
entrance. You half slide, half climb down the
tunnel--further back into time--then you lose
your balance. You fall a great distance, land in
deep water, and sink a long ways.
 You are barely able to surface and, when you
do, you find that the air is filled with dense fog. The
water is warm, but the fog is so thick you can
hardly breathe. The air smells slightly of sulphur.
Gasping for breath, yourealize you must be sev-
eral billion years in the past and that oxygen has
not yet been released into the atmosphere.
