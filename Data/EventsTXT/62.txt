 Your friends are understanding about your wish
to find the way back to your own time, but they tell
you they can show you something you never
dreamed of. Since their society is very primitive,
you wonder what they could have in mind.
 Next day they lead you to another cove where
the waves roll in, rise up against the cliff and then
roll out again. Sometimes the waves clap against
each other and send a foamy spray of water high in
the air. You see some young people on tiny
rafts-nothing more than surfboards-riding in on
the crests of the waves and then riding them out on
the rebound. In a few hours you have leamed a
sport that brings excitement and fascination for
hour after hour.
 With such delights as this, it is not long before
you lose interest in returning to your own time.
Sometimes you wonder, but you never leam,
whether this paradise lies in the future or the past.
