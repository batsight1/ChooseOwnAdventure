 As you iand, the mammoth shudders like a
horse shaking off flies. It begins lumbering along
up the valley, apparently unaware you are stiil
clinging to its wooly back, keeping warm and en-
joying the ride.
 The marnmoth reaches high ground, nibbles at
some bark, and then walks on. Perhaps it will carry
you near some cave men who will give you food
and shelter.
 Suddenly the mammoth stops and turns its
head---listening for something. You look up and
see human figures approaching frorn two sides.
They are carrying spears and clubs. The mam-
moth begins to run. You hold on tight. The hunters
follow---screaming and yelling. You can't see
where the mammoth is heading, but you're afraid
the hunters may drive it off a cliff. Yet, if you jump
off while it's running, you could be badly hurt.
