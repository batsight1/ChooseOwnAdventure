 You walk along the left-hand passageway, pass-
ing tunnels from time to time, none of which looks
like a particularly appealing route. You decide to
see if you can reach the end of the passageway.
 You walk on and on, hour after hour. Then, in
the distance, you see a figure approaching--a girl
wearing blue jeans and a red sweater and carrying
a backpack. She tells you that her name is Louisa
and that she was exploring a cave and got lost. She
does not know she is in the Cave of Time.
