 You make friendly gestures. The man holding
the vine steps back and smiles. The people talk to
you in a friendly fashion, but you cannot under-
stand what they are saying, nor can they under-
stand you. You feel awkward, but happy to be safe
and warm for the moment.
 Several people have gone back to working on
their paintings. You decide to try communicating
through drawing. You begin to draw a picture of
yourself eating. The care people laugh, but one of
them brings you a slive of half-cooked meat. It
doesn't taste very good, but you are so hungry you
don't mind
Gradually you make friends and learn a few
words. Some of the people go hunting and come
back with game. Others make clothing from ani-
mal skins. You help with cleaning and cooking and
each day paint a picture on the walls. The others
are fascinated by your drawings of airplanes, ships,
and cars---things they see only as abstract designs,
for they have no way of knowing what function
they could serve.
 One day a group of other people visit. You have
never seen them before, but your friends welcome
them warmly, holding a great feast in their honor.
After everyone is through eating, the conversation
intensifies. You can tell that the cave people are
talking about a serious problem. Then, one by
one, they drift off to sleep. You walk outside to see
if you can learn anything. The ground is covered
with deep snow. A bitter cold wind blows the snow
in whirling clouds.
 Next morning, the people pack up their belong-
ings and they urge you to do so also. Some migr-
ation is obviously intended---no doubt to a warmer
climate. You feel you should go with the cave
people, but you have a great longing to return to
your own home, and your only hope of doing so is
to find your way back to the Cave of Time.
