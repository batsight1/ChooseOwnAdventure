 "And why do you want to be back with your
family and friends?" the old man asks.
 "Because I will miss them and could hardly bear
not to see them again. And my family and friends
would be sad not to see me."
 "You think of others, and you think of yourself
too," he replies. "That is a good reason to be in
your own time. Take the next tunnel to your right,
and you will find your way there. You have chosen
to have only one time, have you not?"
 "That is true," you reply.
 "Then make the most of it," he says, with one
hand outstretched to wish you well.
