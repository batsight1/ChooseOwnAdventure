Dressed as warmly as possible in your crude
boots and coat of animal skins, you leave shortly
after sunup with the others, a ragged band of thirty
men, women, and children. Luckily th'ere are no
babies; they could never survive the migration.
The sun shows briefly through the clouds, the wind
abates, and you make good progress on your
southward jotrmey.
After only a few days of travel, everyone is
nearing exhaustion. The hunters have not been
able to find enough game. There is no way to light
a fire at night and the only way to keep from
freenng is to sleep huddled together.
After a week though, you notice the sun shines
more warrnly at midday and the snow is not quite
so deep.'It begins to look as though you will sur-
vive, though you must give up hope of ever return-
ing to your own time.
