It's less than a mile to Parkersville, and the Pres-
ident shakes your hand and wishes you luck. One
of the soldiers arranges with the station agent for a
carriage to take you to a form owned by an old
friend of his.
You soon become a member of the family. They
are good people and make you feel very much at
home. You are suprised to learn, however, that
they plan to sell their farm and move to California.
They new life in the West they describe is so appeal-
ing that you decide to go with them.
You never regret it, except, sometimes, you
with you could see your own time again.
