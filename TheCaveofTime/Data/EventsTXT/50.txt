Holding your knife with its long ivory blade
pointing upward, you advance very slowly, step by
step, toward the wolf, which stands growling softly,
apparently confused by your boldness.
Then it springs. You lunge with your knife, twist-
ing your body to avoid its awesome fangs. Your
knife cuts through nothing but air, but the wolf
succeeds only in tearing off your bearskin coat. It
stops for an instant to sniff at the coat, and you tum
and plunge your knife into its neck. The wolf twists,
looks at you with hate in its eyes, and falls limp, its
spinal cord severed.
Now you are a true Stone Age hunter. You skin
the wolf and walk into the cave.
You follow the righlhand tunnel, thinking you
may find your way back to your own time, but
suddenly you feel yourself falling-faster and fast-
er into what seems a bottomless pit.
