You walk along the right-hand passageway for a
long clisiance, praying that you can find a iunnei
that wiil lead to your own time. You choose one ai
the n:any tunnels you see and follow it. Instead oi
rising to the surface, you enter a brightly-lightecl
chamber, in the center of which is a bearded, oiC
man seateci in a chair.
"Welcorne," he says, as if he has been expecting you.
"Thank you," you reply. "Can you help me fir:C
my way back to my own time?"
The old man srniles. "First of all," he says, "tell
me why you want to return to your own time
instead of another time."
