You hug your friends good-bye and climb the
ridge bordering the jungle. You soon find an ani-
mal hail leading through the dense undergrowth
into a tropical rain forest. The green canopy of
treetops is far overhead and only an occasional
dapple of sunlight reaches the spongy, dark
ground. You walk on and on, hoping to reach the
mountains, where you might find another en-
trance to the Cave of Time.
Night falls and you make yourself a crude bed.
Your mattress is the mossy floor of the forest. You
spread out fem leaves for a sheet. Early the next
moming, as the birds are beginning their moming
songs, you are awakened by the boa constrictor
wrapped around your neck.
