You continue on, following a trail leading up a
steep incline. You hear loud, bumpeting sounds
from a nearby ravine-the sounds of a large ani-
mal.You climb over some rocks and find vourself
looking down on one of the largest land mammals
that ever lived-the wooly mammoth. Huge as
this creature is, its dize is exaggerated even more by
its thick coat of wool.
You are cold, desperate, and tired. From your
rock ledge, only a few feetoverthe mammoth, you
could drop down on its back, burrow into its warn
wool, and ride where it takes you!
