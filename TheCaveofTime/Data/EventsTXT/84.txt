You run upthe hill and outof sightbefore any of
the primitive people awaken. You must find an
entance to the Cave of Time. You search in the
high rocky ground for some opening. Hours go by;
dusk is fast approaching. Just as you are about to
glve up hope, you spy the entrance to a cave under
a rock ledge. You eagerly step inside and have
only a momenf s awareness that it is the den of a
saber-toothed tiger.
