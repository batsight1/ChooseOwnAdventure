You can see no future for yourself .with these
primitive peopie, so yorl run back towarci the Cave
of Time. Fortunately, they do not follow you, and
you are able to find your way.
By the time you re-enter the cave, you are hun-
gry and exhausted. The light is dimmer than be-
fore and you grope your way along, looking for a
passageway. You stumble and fall headfirst down
agreeably. You look up and see daylight ahead. A
minute later, you walk out of the cave into warm,
moist air near a foest of leafy trees. A bird flies by.
You don't know when it is, but it looks pleasant enough
As you iand, ihe mammoth shudders lihe a
horse shaking otf flies. It begins iumbering along
up the valley, apparently unaware you are stiil
clinging to its wooly back, keeping warm and enjoying the ride.
The marnmoth reaches high ground, nibbles at
sorne bark, and then walks on. Perhaps it willcarry
you near sorne cave men who will give you food
and shelter.
Suddeniy the mammoth stops and turns its
head-listening for something. You look up and
see human figures approaching frorn two sides.
They are carrying spears and clubs. The mam-
moth begins to run. You hold on tight. The hunters
follow-screaming and yelling. You can't see
where the mammoth is heading, but you're afraid
the hunters may drive it off a cliff. Yet, if you jump
off while it's running, you could be badly hurt.
