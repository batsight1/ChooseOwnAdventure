You step into a niche in the rocks to escape the
merciless blast of wind and lean back against the
rock wall. Suddenly it crumbles under your
weight, causing you to fall backward down a
muddy slope and into a pond.
The sun shines brighfly down on you as you pick
yourself up, dripping wet, and wade to the grassy
shore. You look back at the rock, rising out of the
pond, but you can't see where you fell through.
While you are collecting your senses, a horse
comes prancing up, its rider dressed in tin
armor-a knight out of the history booksenough to make you laugh. The horseman lifts off
his helmet and laughs himself.
"What a place for a bath!" he calls out. "Well, it
was worth it-you're cleaner than a pig!" He almost falls off his horse, he is laughing so hard. "But
climb on and I'll take you back to the casfle," he
says. "We'll see if we can't make a human out of
you yet."
