"l am a philosopher," the old man says, "who,
when asked to choose a time, insiead chose
timelessness, so that, although nothing would ever
happen in my life, I would have all the time in the
world to think about it."
"Are you happy with your decision?"
"No, because philosophy is nothing outside of
time. Take the tunnel to your right. Return to your
own time, and let your life be your philosophy."
