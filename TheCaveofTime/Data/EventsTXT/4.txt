As you start walking back toward the ranch, you
notice the trail seems very diflerent than you remember it, though of course moonlight can play
tricks on your eyes. But you suddenly realize you
are not walking on the hail at all, but on what
sâ‚¬ems to be a dried-up river bed. You hurry back
to the cave entrance. You look around vou and
realize the whole landscape has changei. Wtit"
you were in the cave, torrents of water have
washed out the trail; yet there is not so much as a
puddle left. You shiver. It is cold, much colder than
it should be at this time of year. You take a jacket
out of your backpack and put it on, but you are still
freezing.
fu least the world about you seems brighter. It's
gfiing lid,t in tre easL The sun will soon be up.
\-otr bok at your watch. ft has run down, though
pu -,ror-nrd il ordy a fan hours ago. Nothing seems
