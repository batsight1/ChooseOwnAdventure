The guard is too startled, and maybe even too
afraid, to stop you as you dart past him and out of
the jail house. You run down the street as fast as
you can. As you stop to catch your breaht, a thin,
beared man driving a coach pulls up next to you.
"You seem to be in some trouble." he calls out.
"Can I be of help?"
Too tired to make up any story, you begin to tell
him everything that has happened to you. He is
very excited by your story and invites you to a
nearby tavern, where you have your first good
meal since you left Red Creek ranch. Your host
hardly eats anything. He looks pale and seems to
have a bad cough.
When you finish recounting your tale, he says,
"lt is strange that we have met. I have tuberculosis,
and no doctor in Boston can help me. My only
hope is to reach a future time."
"l think it's my only hope too," you say.
"lf we help each other, I think we can find our
way back to your time-my new tim e," he replies.
The two of you shake hands on it and set out on
your quest the next day at sunrise.
Together, you are successful in finding your way
to the present time. Your friend from the past is
cured with the help of modem medicines and later
becomes a history teacher who is known through-
out the countryr for his amazing knowledge of life in
colonial America.
