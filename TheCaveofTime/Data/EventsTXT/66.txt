You accept the offer, for you can hardly expect a
better life at this point, and soon you begin to enjoy
rowing out in the early morning mists and spread-
ing your nets with the neighbouring fishermen.
One afternoon, as the people are pulling up
their boats for the night, your friend, Angus
McPhee, raises a cry and points at the water. You
look out and see the great head and neck of a sea
monster-a htige dragon of the lake. Nearby,
splinters of wood are floating in the water.
"That was Sutherland's boat," Angus cries out.
"lt's been a hundred years since the monster has
been seen, but now it has retumed!"
The monster swims away and soon is lost from
view in the mists.
"How could the monster be gone for a hundred
years and then return?" you ask Angus. 
"Somewhere near Beatty's Point," he replies,
"there is an cave where the monster
stays as long as it pleases-because it is a Cave of
Time."
lf only you could find your way back to the Cave
of Time! But chances seem slim, and the risks
seem great.
