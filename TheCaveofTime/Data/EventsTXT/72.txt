With your aunt and uncle and some ranch
hands standing by, you very gently tap the egg
with an axe, hoping it will Split open without fragmenting.
"Wait a minute!" Uncle Howard cries out. "l'm
ready to believe you, but I think we better get a
naturalist down from the University to see this
first."
You are relieved that your uncle feels this way,
because it seems like a tenible responsibility--
cracking open an egg like that and possibly killing a
rare monster before it is bom.
Uncle Howard calls the nafuralist, a famous pro-
fessor of paleontology, who agrees to come down
the following Saturday. You place the egg in a
large bowl in the middle of the dining room table.
The neg day is Friday, and that evening the
whole family goes out to the movies. When you
retum, you find the house has been broken into
and the egg is missing,
Neitheryou, yourauntand uncle, noranyof the
ranch hands, nor the police are ever able to find
the egg. Most people you tell your story to just
smile and say, "Sure." But Uncle Howard, even
though he is a skeptical man, tells you he knows
you were telling the truth.
