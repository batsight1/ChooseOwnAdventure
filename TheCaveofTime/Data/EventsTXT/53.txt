You hold tightly to tufts of wool, hoping the
mammoth will slow down enough so you can
safely slide off. But suddenly it pitches forward,
making a terrible bellowing. In an instant you
realize you are falling through space. You cry out
helplessly as you lose your grip, falling faster and
hster.
Thousands of years later when Dr. Carleton
Frisbee, the famous paleontologist, finds your
bones next to those of a wooly mammoth in the
Red Creek excavation, he is amazed at how
closely you resemble a twentieth-century human
being.
